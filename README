Overview
--------
nss-dontstalk me is a nsswitch module that maps host lookups of well known web
trackers to localhost so they become uneffective. 

The idea is to have the same black lists available regardless of the browser/application used.

While doing this via /etc/host would be possible there's no /etc/hosts.d mechanism to
keep the changes separate. Also maintaining this for ipv4 and ipv6 can be cumbersome.

Compiling
---------
nss-dontstalkme uses autotools to build the package:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make

Installation
------------
Make sure libnss-dontstalkme.so.2 is in your libraries load path
either installing it into the filesystem

    make install

or, if you want to run from the built source, by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/src/.libs

Afterwards add dontstalkme to the hosts entry of /etc/nsswitch.conf e.g. change

    hosts: files myhostname mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4n

to

    hosts: files myhostname mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dontstalkme dns mdns4

It's important to add the `dontstalkme` entry before the `dns` entry.

Testing
-------
You can test the basic functionality by running

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/src/.libs/ getent ahostsv4 google-analytics.com
